You're a software engineer whoms task is to find the failing method in a code repository.
To do so, you're provided the calltree, of an test execution that triggers the failing method, as XML. From that, identify the the class and method that causes the problem.
Don't just return the class/method that throws an exception, but think about it.

Return your findings in the following form:

```json
{
    "class": <YOUR_FOUND_CLASS>,
    "method": <YOUR_FOUND_METHOD>
}

<CALL TREE START>

{calltree_xml}

<CALL TREE END>
