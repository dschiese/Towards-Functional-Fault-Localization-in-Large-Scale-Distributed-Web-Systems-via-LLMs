# Outputs

This directory contains the per-bug analysis artifacts produced by the pipeline for all 1,158 branches across 8 projects from the bugs-dot-jar dataset.

Each project directory contains one subdirectory per bug branch, named after the bugs-dot-jar branch identifier (e.g., `bugs-dot-jar_MATH-294_2c8a114f`).

## Per-Branch Contents

Each branch directory contains up to three files:

| File | Description | Source |
|------|-------------|--------|
| `developer-patch.diff` | The ground-truth bug fix patch | Downloaded from GitHub by `pipeline/fetch_and_analyze.py` |
| `test-results.txt` | Maven test execution log showing failures | Downloaded from GitHub by `pipeline/fetch_and_analyze.py` |
| `analysis.json` | Structured analysis result (see below) | Generated by the pipeline |

## `analysis.json` Schema

```json
{
  "patched": ["org.example.ClassName"],
  "test": ["org.example.TestClass"],
  "suitable_tests": ["TestClass"],
  "suitable_test_methods": [
    {
      "failingTest": {
        "failingTestClass": "TestClass",
        "failingTestMethod": "testMethodName"
      }
    }
  ],
  "sourcePackage": "module-name"
}
```

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `patched` | Fully-qualified class name(s) modified by the fix (ground-truth super-component) |
| `test` | All failing test class names identified by the LLM |
| `suitable_tests` | Subset of `test` where the test class does not directly test the patched class |
| `suitable_test_methods` | Specific failing test method(s) within each suitable test class |
| `sourcePackage` | Maven module containing the patched class (used for AspectJ scoping) |

## `no_equi_patch.txt`

Lists branches where no equivalent (suitable) test was found after Step 2 filtering. These branches were excluded from further processing.
