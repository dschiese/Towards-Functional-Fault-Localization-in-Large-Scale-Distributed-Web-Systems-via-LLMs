This directory contains input reference data used by the pipeline and evaluation scripts.

## Files

### Project Lists

**`working-examples-jdk6.txt`**
The initial list of 186 bugs-dot-jar branches that compiled successfully with JDK 6 + Maven 2.5.3. Used as the starting set before suitability filtering.

**`working-examples-jdk6-with-suitable-tests.txt`**
Filtered subset of branches that have at least one suitable test (i.e., a test class that does not directly test the patched class). Generated by [`pipeline/check_working_jdk_and_suitable_projects.py`](../pipeline/check_working_jdk_and_suitable_projects.py). Used as input for Step 4 (test execution and call graph tracing).

### Experiment Results

**`experiments.xlsx`**
Main results spreadsheet for all 53 evaluated experiments. Contains per-experiment LLM predictions, ground-truth fault locations, correctness labels, distance metrics, and the LLM model used for each experiment. This is the primary data source for the evaluation notebooks and figures.

See [`results/README.md`](../results/README.md) for the full column description.

### Call Tree Sample

**`methods_hierarchy.xml`**
A sample XML-serialized call tree, illustrating the format passed to the LLM during evaluation (Step 4). The format uses nested `<method>` elements where `<called>` represents the callee sub-tree, and each node contains the method name, parameter values, and return value.

This format is produced by [`pipeline/build_hierarchy.py`](../pipeline/build_hierarchy.py) from a Virtuoso SPARQL query.
